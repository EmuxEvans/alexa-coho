# Node.js for Alexa Connected Home Skills

##Alexa Lighting API Documentation
The documentation for the Alexa Lighting API is available  [here](https://developer.amazon.com/public/binaries/content/assets/html/alexa-lighting-api.html).

## Contents
This repository includes a Node.js sample for an AWS Lambda function that is an adapter for an Alexa skill. The LightingAPI folder contains a sample virtual device that you can use as a basis for your own Lambda function. The sample demonstrates:
- Responding to discovery messages
- Responding to triggered events (on / off)
- Making a simple call to an HTTPS endpoint

## Usage
You can use the LightingAPI/SampleVirtualDevice.js sample in step 2 of the “What You Need to Do” section of the [Alexa Lighting API documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/public/binaries/content/assets/html/alexa-lighting-api.html).  After you complete the remaining steps in the “What You Need to Do” section, test by linking and running discovery.  In the Alexa companion app, when you navigate through Settings to Connected Home, you should see a dummy light.
